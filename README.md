# MORITS

This is the official repository for the MHC outstanding residue identifying tool for sequence alignment (MORITS).

MORITS is ready to be used under Microsoft Windows. You can use the two provided input files to run a peptide search between environmental allergens and SARS-CoV-2 by 
1. loading them in the MORITS tool,
2. select the desired TCEM (or all three options)
3. select the stringency of filtering (100% match = no mismatches allowed, 80% match = 1 mismatch along TCEM allowed)
4. press "Find Matches"
5. save your result list in the end.

The output list can be important in Microsoft Excel (or your preferred Software) to generate .fasta files to proceed with MHC binding prediction. The MHC binding prediction is not part of the MORITS tool.
